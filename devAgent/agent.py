        'Rules:\n'
        '- Make minimal, targeted changes that resolve the bug without regressions.\n'
        '- Preserve existing code style and formatting; do not reformat unrelated code.\n'
        '- Add or adjust basic defensive checks (e.g., null guards) only when necessary.\n'
        '- When a bug is unclear or cannot be reproduced locally, add clarifying notes in BUGS.md instead of guessing.\n\n'
        'Output:\n'
        '- Modify code files in-place to implement fixes.\n'
        '- Update BUGS.md: for each fixed item, change "- [ ]" to "- [x]" and append "Resolved by Dev Agent on [YYYY-MM-DD]".\n'
        '- If new follow-up tasks are needed, add them as new unchecked items with clear titles.'
